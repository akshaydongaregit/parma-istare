# How can we implement has-a relation in java?
**Association** is a relation between two separate classes which **establishes through their Objects.** Association can be 
- one-to-one, 
- one-to-many, 
- many-to-one, 
- many-to-many. 

In Object-Oriented programming, an Object communicates to an other object to use functionality and services provided by that object.**Composition** and **Aggregation** are the two forms of association.
